# üîë What is a Lock?

A **lock** is a concurrency mechanism that ensures **mutual exclusion** ‚Äî i.e., only one thread at a time can access a critical section (shared resource).

In Java, there are two major ‚Äúeras‚Äù of locks:

1. **Intrinsic Locks (a.k.a. Monitor Locks)** ‚Üí from the beginning of Java (via `synchronized`).
2. **Explicit Locks** (from `java.util.concurrent.locks` package in Java 5 onwards).

---

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Intrinsic Locks (Synchronized)

When you use `synchronized`, you‚Äôre using an **intrinsic lock** associated with every Java object.

Example:

```java
synchronized(obj) {
    // only one thread at a time can execute this block for 'obj'
}
```

* The lock is tied to the **object‚Äôs monitor**.
* If a thread holds the lock, others must wait (**BLOCKED**) until it‚Äôs released.
* **Automatic acquisition & release** ‚Üí you don‚Äôt explicitly unlock.

üëâ Simple but limited (no try-lock, no fairness policies, no interruption control).

---

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explicit Locks (`java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`)

Introduced in Java 5 (`java.util.concurrent`), the **Lock interface** provides **more flexible locking mechanisms** than `synchronized`.

### Example: Using `ReentrantLock`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class LockDemo {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock(); // acquire lock
        try {
            count++;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // always release lock
        }
    }
}
```

üîπ Advantages over `synchronized`:

* `tryLock()` ‚Üí attempt to get lock without blocking forever.
* `lockInterruptibly()` ‚Üí can respond to interrupts while waiting.
* Can make **fair locks** (threads acquire in order).

---

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Locks in Java

### (a) **Reentrant Lock (default)**

* Same thread can acquire the lock multiple times.
* Must `unlock()` the same number of times.
* Both `synchronized` and `ReentrantLock` are **reentrant**.

---

### (b) **Fair vs Unfair Locks**

* **Unfair (default)**: Thread scheduling may not follow order of arrival. This can be faster.
* **Fair**: Locks granted in FIFO order. Use:

  ```java
  ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fair lock
  ```

---

### (c) **ReadWriteLock**

* Allows **multiple readers** but only **one writer** at a time.
* Useful for data that‚Äôs read frequently but rarely modified.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

ReentrantReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
rwLock.readLock().lock();   // many threads can hold read lock
rwLock.readLock().unlock();
rwLock.writeLock().lock();  // only one thread at a time
rwLock.writeLock().unlock();
```

---

### (d) **StampedLock (Java 8)**

* Provides **optimistic reads** ‚Üí allows reading without locking unless a write is happening.
* More performant for highly concurrent read-heavy applications.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock;

StampedLock stampedLock = new StampedLock();
long stamp = stampedLock.tryOptimisticRead();
// do some work
if (!stampedLock.validate(stamp)) {
    // upgrade to real read lock if data might have changed
}
```

---

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Other Locking Mechanisms

* **Semaphore** ‚Üí controls number of permits (e.g., only N threads allowed).
* **CountDownLatch / CyclicBarrier** ‚Üí coordination between threads.
* **Condition variables** (from `Lock.newCondition()`) ‚Üí more advanced wait/notify control.

---

# üéØ Interview Nuggets

* **Difference between synchronized and Lock** ‚Üí

    * `synchronized` is simpler, auto-release, intrinsic lock.
    * `Lock` is more powerful (tryLock, fair locks, interruptible, multiple lock types).
* **ReentrantLock vs ReadWriteLock** ‚Üí one exclusive lock vs multiple readers.
* **StampedLock** ‚Üí added in Java 8 for better read performance.

üëâ Would you like me to draw a **comparison table of `synchronized` vs `ReentrantLock` vs `ReadWriteLock`** (something interviewers love asking)?


Perfect üëç this is one of the **most asked comparison questions** in Java concurrency interviews. Here‚Äôs a clean side-by-side comparison you can keep in mind:

# üìù Key Takeaways

* Use **`synchronized`** ‚Üí if you need **simplicity** and just mutual exclusion.
* Use **`ReentrantLock`** ‚Üí if you need **advanced control** (tryLock, fairness, multiple conditions).
* Use **`ReadWriteLock`** ‚Üí if your app is **read-heavy** and you want multiple readers with only one writer.

---

‚ö° Pro-tip for interviews: If asked *‚ÄúWhich one do you prefer in real-world Spring Boot apps?‚Äù* ‚Üí
üëâ **Start with `synchronized` for simplicity** unless profiling shows contention. Then move to `ReentrantLock` or `ReadWriteLock` for **scalability** in multi-threaded apps (e.g., caching, shared state).
